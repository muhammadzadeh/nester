# Technical Architecture Overview with Design Principles

This project adheres to the principles of Clean Code, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and employs design patterns such as the Repository Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern, and Strategy Pattern to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

## The Layers

Our project is made up of layers, each with its own job:

- **Module A**: This is the main part of our project.
  - **Application**: This is where we decide what to do with our project. It's like the instructions for building something.
    - **Usecases**: These are the steps we need to follow. It's like a list of instructions.
      - **Command**: This is the first step. It's like picking up the first Lego block.
      - **Usecase Implementation**: This is how we put the instructions into action. It's like following the steps to build a part of our project.
    - **Services**: These are the tools we use. They help us put the parts together.
    - **Exception**: This is like a safety catch. If something goes wrong, it stops us from making a mistake.
  - **Domain**: This is the blueprint of our project. It tells us what parts we need and how they fit together.
    - **Entities Model**: This is like the design of our project. It shows us what the final product will look like.
    - **Repositories Interface**: This is like a guide that tells us where to put each part.
    - **Exceptions**: This is like a warning sign. It tells us if we're doing something that might not work.
  - **Infrastructure**: This is where we store the parts of our project. It's like the box where we keep our Lego pieces.
    - **Database**: This is where we keep the parts that we've already used. It's like a storage box for our Lego pieces.
      - **Entities Implementation**: This is how we store the parts in the database. It's like putting the blocks into the storage box.
      - **Repositories Implementation**: This is how we organize the parts in the storage box. It's like sorting the blocks so we can find them easily.
    - **Web**: This is like the play area where we build our project. It's where we put together the parts to create our final product.
      - **DTO**: These are the instructions for building a specific part of our project. It's like a guide for a specific Lego project.
      - **Controller**: This is like the person who decides what to build next. It's like the person who decides which Lego blocks to use next.
      - **Validator**: This is like a quality check. It makes sure we're using the right parts and putting them together correctly.
      - **Pipe**: This is like a tool that helps us build our project. It's like a special tool that makes it easier to put the parts together.
      - **Decorator**: This is like adding special features to our project. It's like adding special stickers or parts to make our project more interesting.
